  * <code>Main.main()</code> has the main program
  * <code>WorldView.update()</code> is the simulation loop
* Testers
  * Make similar testers for other packages.

## Instructions

## How to run the simulator

* Step 1: Edit or create the simulator's configuration file.
  * <code>src/config.txt</code> is the base experimental configuration file.
* Step 2: Run <code>Main.main()</code>
  * It will prompt you for the configuration file.
  * Enter <code>src/config.txt</code>
* Step 3: If the configuration file loads correctly, you will see:
